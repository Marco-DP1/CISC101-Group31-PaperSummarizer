### **Module 3 — Guardrails**

- Missing/Empty Section Check: Flag if section text is absent.
- Short Summary Warning: Warn if summary <50 words.
- Hallucination Prevention: Summarize only provided text.
- Chunking Strategy: Split long sections into smaller parts, summarize individually, then merge.

**Strict Evidence Mode*
- `evidence_mode = "strict"`
* The summarizer should: 
>      * Only include claims, equations, and results that appear in the provided text.
>      * If it cannot find enough information, it must say so explicitly (e.g., “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”).

**Section Warning Messages**
For sections that are:
 >    * missing / empty, or
>    * too short (< 50 words) 
>    The module must instruct the system to output a **standardized warning**, such as:
> * “Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”
> * “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”
